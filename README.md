## üß™ **Testing Your App**

### **Sample Notes for Testing**
```
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data. Supervised learning uses labeled datasets to train predictive models. Unsupervised learning discovers hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Deep learning employs neural networks with multiple layers to process complex information and make accurate predictions.
```

### **Test Cases**
1. **Basic MCQ Generation**: Paste sample notes, select "Multiple Choice Questions", generate quiz
2. **Flashcard Generation**: Use same notes, select "Flashcards", test navigation
3. **Edge Cases**: Test with very short notes (should show error), very long notes (should handle gracefully)
4. **Mobile Testing**: Open on mobile device, verify responsive design

### **API Testing**
```bash
# Test health check
curl https://hackathon3-306b.onrender.com/health

# Test API functionality
curl -X POST https://hackathon3-306b.onrender.com/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"notes": "Test notes about biology", "quiz_type": "mcq", "num_questions": 3}'
```

## üé¨ **Demo Resources**

### **Test Data for Judges**
```
Biology: "Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down glucose to produce ATP. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and converts glucose to pyruvate. The Krebs cycle happens in the mitochondrial matrix. The electron transport chain produces most ATP through oxidative phosphorylation."

Computer Science: "Machine learning algorithms learn patterns from training data to make predictions on new data. Supervised learning requires labeled examples while unsupervised learning finds structure in unlabeled datasets. Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex relationships."

History: "The Industrial Revolution began in Britain during the late 18th century. Steam engines revolutionized manufacturing and transportation. Factory systems replaced traditional cottage industries. This period saw massive urbanization as people moved from rural areas to industrial cities."
